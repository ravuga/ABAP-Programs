Write an executable program with two parameters which represents a base and exponent. Print the result of exponentiation. As both parameters are required for the operation they should be mandatory.


Solution:



REPORT	z_abap101_067.

PARAMETERS p_base TYPE p LENGTH 5 OBLIGATORY.

PARAMETERS p_exp TYPE i OBLIGATORY.

START-OF-SELECTION.

DATA v_result TYPE f.

v_result = p_base ** p_exp.

WRITE: v_result EXPONENT 0.
