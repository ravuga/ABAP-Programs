Declare two constants which contain the values 'X' (true) and ' ' (false).

Note: This is a common practice as ABAP does not contain a boolean primitive type.



Solution:


REPORT	z_abap101_032.

TYPES ty_boolean TYPE c. " what is the length?

CONSTANTS c_true TYPE ty_boolean VALUE 'X'.

CONSTANTS c_false TYPE ty_boolean VALUE space.
