Declare a structure type with 5 fields, each field with the same types from exercises 1 to 5.



Solution:



REPORT	z_abap101_006.

TYPES customer_name TYPE c LENGTH 10.

DATA number_of_employees TYPE i.

TYPES number_of_unpaid_invoices TYPE n LENGTH 7.

TYPES creation_date TYPE d.

TYPES last_changed_at TYPE t.

TYPES: BEGIN OF customer_structure,

name TYPE	customer_name,

n_employees LIKE number_of_employees,

unpaid_invoices TYPE number_of_unpaid_invoices,

creation_date TYPE d,

last_changed_at TYPE t,

END OF customer_structure.



Notes:

(semicolon) is recommend in this case name - This is a char with length 10
n_employees - This component (called ‘n_employees’ has the same type of the variable, but it is not reusable)
