# ABAP-Programs
HELLO GUYS, THIS IS MY ABAP REPO WHERE I AM PUSHING ALL MY CODE THAT I PRACTICE WHILE LEARNING ABAP PROGRAMMING.



ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming, originally Allgemeiner Berichts-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor, German for "general report creation processor") is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE. It is currently positioned, alongside Java, as the language for programming the SAP Application Server, which is part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.
