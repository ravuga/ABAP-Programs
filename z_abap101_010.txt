Declare a structure containing all the fields mentioned in exercises 8 and 9. Check it using the ABAP Debugger.


Solution:



REPORT	z_abap101_010.

* 2nd Option - Reusing TYPES keyword

TYPES: BEGIN OF some_components_sflight_2,

END OF flight_booking.

Note that some_components_sflight_2 and flight_booking have components with the same name


'carrid', 'connid' and 'fldate'. 2 components cannot have the same name so

in the structure below we add a suffix for each component originated in the local


structure flight_booking

TYPES: BEGIN OF sflight_sbook.

INCLUDE TYPE some_components_sflight_2.

INCLUDE TYPE flight_booking AS book RENAMING WITH SUFFIX _book.

TYPES END OF sflight_sbook.
