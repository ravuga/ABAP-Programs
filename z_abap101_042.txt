Write an executable program that get two integers inside variables and perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power between them.


Solution:



REPORT	z_abap101_042.

DATA v_number_a TYPE i.

DATA v_number_b LIKE v_number_a VALUE 2.

DATA v_result TYPE f .

START-OF-SELECTION.

v_number_a = 5.

v_result = v_number_a + v_number_b.

WRITE: 'Adition:', v_result EXPONENT 0 .

NEW-LINE.

v_result = v_number_a - v_number_b.

WRITE: 'Subtraction:', v_result.

NEW-LINE.

v_result = v_number_a * v_number_b.

WRITE: 'Multiplication:', v_result.

NEW-LINE.

v_result = v_number_a / v_number_b.

WRITE: 'Division:', v_result.

NEW-LINE.

v_result = v_number_a ** v_number_b.

WRITE: 'Power:', v_result.
