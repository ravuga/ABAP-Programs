Write an executable program which contains three internal tables (their type must contain at least three components of different data types). Each table will have a different type (standard, sorted and hashed). Add 3 identical values in each table and view the contents of each table in the debugger.


Solution:



REPORT	z_abap101_060.

TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_line,

id TYPE c LENGTH 10,

name TYPE string,

value TYPE i,

END OF ty_line.

DATA it_standard TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_line.

DATA it_sorted TYPE SORTED TABLE OF ty_line WITH UNIQUE KEY id.

DATA it_hashed TYPE HASHED TABLE OF ty_line WITH UNIQUE KEY id.

START-OF-SELECTION.

DATA wa TYPE ty_line.

wa-id = '3'.

wa-name = 'John'.

wa-value = 50.

APPEND wa TO it_standard.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_sorted.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_hashed.

wa-id = '2'.

wa-name = 'Mary'.

wa-value = 60.

APPEND wa TO it_standard.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_sorted.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_hashed.

wa-id = '1'.

wa-name = 'Max'.

wa-value = 30.

APPEND wa TO it_standard.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_sorted.

INSERT wa INTO TABLE it_hashed.

BREAK-POINT.
